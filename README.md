# Tutorial-Murder-Mystery
## Step 1: 
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/blob/main/step1"
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/tree/main/detective_handbook"

+ You need to search for lines in the file marked with the word 'CLUE'. Use the `grep` command to do this.
+ Create file 'clues.txt'
+ Use `>` to save the output of the `grep` command to the 'clues.txt' file.
 
## Step 1-Git: Tutorial Update File to Github
+ Step1: $git checkout main
+ Step2: $git status
+ Step3: $git add .    
+ Step4: $git commit -m "Your Message"
+ Step5: $git push origin main

## Step 2:
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/blob/main/step2"
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/blob/main/hint1"

+ Create file 'could_witnesses.txt'
+ Try to search for 'Annabel' in the 'people' file. And save into file 'could_witnesses.txt'

## Step 3:
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/blob/main/step3"
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/tree/main/detective_handbook"

+ You found 4 matches for the name 'Annabel'. Only 2 of them are women so you can rule out the remainder. 

+ Another piece of information you have is their address. There is a 'streets' subdirectory in the 'mystery' directory with a list of files named after streets.
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/tree/main/mystery/streets"
+ Find streets name in folder "streets"


## Step 4:
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/blob/main/step4"
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/tree/main/detective_handbook"

+ Create a file for your reference called `interviews.txt`
+ Find the relevant line in each of the two address files. Example: line 40 file "Hart_Place".

+ And save the contents to 'interviews.txt'. 
+ Open folder "clmystery/mystery/interviews/". You search file keyword interview from file streets (Example: line 40 file "Hart_Place" > SEE INTERVIEW #47246024)

+ Commit it and push to Github. Read: Step 1-Git: Tutorial Update File to Github

## Step 5:
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/blob/main/step5"
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/tree/main/detective_handbook"


You're concerned that the investigation has been compromised. You use an old detective trick to cover your tracks.

To recover your 'step5' file, use the `git checkout` command to check out the 'step-5' branch, and try to view this file again.

+ Read document: "https://rewind.com/blog/recovering-deleted-files-in-github/"

## Step 6:
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/blob/main/step6"
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/tree/main/detective_handbook"

Now you need to search for multiple keywords in one file. How can you combine `grep` with flags and the pipe operator ('|') to filter the vehicle records for:

* car model
* car color
* license plate number
* suspect's height

+ Create file 'suspects.txt' to save the list of suspects.

## Step 7:
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/blob/main/step7"
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/tree/main/detective_handbook"

## Step 8:
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/blob/main/step8"
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/tree/main/detective_handbook"

## Step 9:
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/blob/main/step9"
+ Read document "https://github.com/makersacademy/clmystery/tree/main/detective_handbook"

+ Create file 'jail.txt'
+ Note: suspect is male
